# TypeDuck Windows

TypeDuck Windows is a Cantonese input method for Windows users in Hong Kong, built on Microsoft Text Services Framework and a TypeDuck Rime runtime.

TypeDuck Windows 係為香港 Windows 用戶而設嘅粵語輸入法，使用 Microsoft Text Services Framework，並配合 TypeDuck Rime Runtime 提供候選字、粵拼同字典式提示。

## Features / 功能

- TypeDuck Cantonese IME registered under Chinese (Traditional, Hong Kong) / `zh-HK`.<br>
  TypeDuck 粵語輸入法會註冊喺「中文（繁體，香港）」/ `zh-HK`。
- Candidate, Jyutping, and dictionary-style details in a Windows candidate window.<br>
  候選窗會顯示候選字、粵拼同字典式資料。
- A bilingual installer, settings window, about dialog, and Start Menu shortcuts.<br>
  雙語安裝程式、設定視窗、關於視窗同開始功能表捷徑。
- Local settings stored per user, with Rime-affecting options applied through the TypeDuck runtime.<br>
  每位用戶有獨立設定；影響 Rime 嘅選項會經 TypeDuck Runtime 套用。

## Repositories

- Frontend and installer: [TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Windows](https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Windows)
- Backend runtime: [TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Windows-backend](https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Windows-backend)

## Architecture

TypeDuck Windows is split into two repositories that ship together:

```text
Windows TSF host apps
        |
        v
TypeDuckTextService.dll
        |
        | per-user named pipe, protobuf frames
        v
TypeDuckLauncher.exe
        |
        | stdin/stdout, protobuf frames
        v
TypeDuckRuntime/server.exe
        |
        v
librime + TypeDuck Rime data + dictionary lookup filter
```

The frontend repository owns TSF registration, COM entry points, candidate UI, launcher IPC, settings/about UI, setup helper, runtime staging, and the installer. The backend repository owns the Go runtime process, protobuf conversion, Rime service, librime binding, settings application to Rime configuration, and packaged runtime output.

## Windows on Arm

The installer contains separate x64-Windows and ARM64-Windows application payloads. On Windows on Arm, `TypeDuckLauncher.exe`, `TypeDuckSettings.exe`, `TypeDuckAbout.exe`, `TypeDuckSetupHelper.exe`, the Go `server.exe`, TypeDuck `rime.dll`, and the TSF DLL all run as native ARM64 binaries. The x86 and x64 TSF DLLs remain packaged for compatibility.

The release workflow reads every staged PE header and fails unless each executable and DLL matches its declared architecture. Native ARM64 and x86-emulated TSF hosts are covered. Full in-process support inside x64-emulated host applications still requires an ARM64X text-service bridge.

## Build Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 for development and validation.
- Visual Studio 2022 with the MSVC x86/x64 and ARM64 build tools plus a Windows 11 SDK.
- CMake 3.21 or newer.
- PowerShell 7 or newer; use `pwsh` for repository scripts.
- Inno Setup 6 for installer builds.
- Go matching the backend module requirement.
- Protocol Buffers `protoc` 33.5 or a local protobuf source tree.
- A TypeDuck Rime schema source directory to pass as `-RimeDataSource`. The directory must include a `build` folder containing the artifacts pre-compiled by librime.
- A recursive checkout of `TypeDuck-HK/librime` at `v1.1.4` to pass as `-Arm64RimeSourceRoot` when building the universal installer.

## Build

Build the Windows frontend binaries:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build.ps1
```

This builds the complete Win32 and native ARM64 solutions plus the x64 text-service DLL in `build-vs32`, `build-vs64`, and `build-vsarm64`.

The build script applies the TypeDuck-owned submodule patches required for the checked-out third-party code. To prepare or verify them without building, run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Apply-TypeDuckSubmodulePatches.ps1
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Apply-TypeDuckSubmodulePatches.ps1 -CheckOnly
```

Build the full installer after the backend runtime and schema source are available:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/_all_in_package.ps1 `
  -RimeDataSource <schema-source> `
  -Arm64RimeSourceRoot <TypeDuck-HK-librime-checkout>
```

The packaging script builds both the x64 runtime and the native ARM64 Go/librime runtime. It then writes the installer to:

```text
installer/dist/typeduck-windows-ime-setup.exe
```

## Installer Command-Line Flags

TypeDuck uses an Inno Setup installer. For managed or bulk deployment, run the installer from an elevated shell:

```powershell
typeduck-windows-ime-setup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /LOG="C:\Temp\TypeDuck-install.log"
```

- `/SILENT` runs installation with a progress window and no wizard pages.
- `/VERYSILENT` runs installation without the wizard or progress window. This is the recommended flag for bulk installation.
- `/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES` answers standard installer message boxes automatically where possible. Use it with `/SILENT` or `/VERYSILENT`.
- `/NORESTART` prevents the installer from restarting Windows automatically. If TSF files are locked, TypeDuck may finish registration after a later restart.
- `/LOG="path"` writes an installer log for deployment diagnostics.
- `/DIR="path"` overrides the install directory. The default is `%ProgramFiles%\TypeDuckIME` on 64-bit Windows.

The silent installer still registers the TSF text service, installs the launcher startup entry, and runs the settings-apply path. It does not open the Settings or About windows at the end.

The uninstaller is installed as `%ProgramFiles%\TypeDuckIME\unins000.exe` on 64-bit Windows and accepts the same silent/logging flags:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\TypeDuckIME\unins000.exe" /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /LOG="C:\Temp\TypeDuck-uninstall.log"
```

Interactive uninstall asks whether to delete personal TypeDuck settings and dictionary data. Silent uninstall skips that prompt and preserves roaming user data under `%APPDATA%\TypeDuckIME`; local TypeDuck logs/cache under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TypeDuckIME` are removed by the uninstaller.

## Runtime Layout

The installed application uses this product layout:

```text
TypeDuckIME/
├── TypeDuckLauncher.exe
├── TypeDuckSettings.exe
├── TypeDuckAbout.exe
├── TypeDuckSetupHelper.exe
├── TypeDuckTextService.dll
├── x64/TypeDuckTextService.dll
├── arm64/TypeDuckTextService.dll
├── resources/
└── TypeDuckRuntime/
    ├── server.exe
    └── input_methods/rime/
```

User data and logs use TypeDuck-specific folders:

- Preferences: `%APPDATA%\TypeDuckIME\TypeDuckPreferences.json`
- Rime user data: `%APPDATA%\TypeDuckIME\Rime`
- Logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TypeDuckIME\Log`

## Testing

Build first, then run CTest against a configured Win32 build:

```powershell
ctest --test-dir build-vs32 -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Useful focused checks:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Test-TypeDuckProtocolContract.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Strict
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Test-TypeDuckCandidateData.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Strict
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Test-TypeDuckSettingsPersistence.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Strict
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Test-TypeDuckReleaseArtifacts.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Strict
```

Cross-repo runtime verification should include the backend test suite and a runtime package build from `TypeDuck-Windows-backend`.

## Protocol

Frontend and backend communicate with Protocol Buffers over length-prefixed binary frames. Protocol changes must update both repository schemas and regenerated bindings:

- The frontend protobuf schema.
- The backend protobuf schema.
- Generated C++ and Go protobuf outputs.

Do not edit generated protobuf files directly.

## Release

The release workflows build on `windows-2022`, checkout both TypeDuck Windows repositories, download the TypeDuck schema release artifact, download protobuf tooling, run the packaging script, and upload the installer asset. Release validation should cover:

- Installer file name and signature/hash evidence.
- Clean install, upgrade, uninstall, and reboot-required registration paths.
- Native ARM64 launcher, settings/about applications, setup helper, Go runtime, librime, and TSF DLLs.
- PE-machine validation for every staged x86, x64, and ARM64 executable and DLL.
- `zh-HK` language profile registration.
- Candidate window and dictionary lookup behavior.
- Settings persistence and Rime side effects.
